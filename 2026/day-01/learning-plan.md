## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering
DevOps is a combination of culture, processes, and tools that enable faster, reliable, and automated delivery of software by improving collaboration between development and operations teams.

Cloud Engineering focuses on designing, deploying, and managing scalable infrastructure and applications on cloud platforms like AWS using automation and infrastructure as code.

Together, DevOps and Cloud help organizations achieve high availability, scalability, and continuous delivery.
